# 111 - NFS

### Network File System

NFS is a distributed file system protocol for sharing over a network. Often used with UNIX operating systems and is predominantly insecure in its implementation. Portmapper and RPCbind both listen on port 111 and redirects clients to appropriate ports, often TCP 2049. 

#### Scan with nmap or use NSE scripts to locate NFS shares 

```text
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254 
```

#### Enumeration

```text
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* $RHOST
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo $RHOST 
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72
rpcinfo -p $targetip
rpcbind $targetip
showmount $targetip -a
```

#### Mounting shares

```text
mkdir home 
mount -o nolock 10.11.1.72:/home directory
```

If files aren't readable, you may be able to create a new user, then use sed to change the UUID of the user to match the requirements \(su username\)
